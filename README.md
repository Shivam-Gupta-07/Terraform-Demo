Project Scenario: Deploying a Scalable WordPress Site on AWS
Overview
You are tasked with deploying a WordPress website that can automatically scale to meet demand and ensure high availability. The website should be secure and perform well under varying loads. This project will involve setting up a highly available architecture on AWS, utilizing services such as Amazon EC2, RDS, and Elastic Load Balancing.

Objectives
Deploy a WordPress site on AWS with high availability.

Utilize RDS for the WordPress database to ensure data durability and ease of management.

Employ an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances.

Implement Auto Scaling to handle changes in traffic.

Use CloudFormation or Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate the deployment.

Requirements
AWS Account

Basic understanding of AWS services (EC2, RDS, ELB, Auto Scaling, VPC)

Familiarity with CloudFormation or Terraform

Architecture
VPC Setup: Create a VPC with public and private subnets across at least two Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.

Database: Deploy a MySQL database using Amazon RDS in a private subnet to store WordPress data.

Web Servers: Launch EC2 instances in public subnets to host the WordPress application. These instances will be placed behind an Elastic Load Balancer.

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distribute incoming traffic to EC2 instances running WordPress.

Auto Scaling Group: Ensure that the number of EC2 instances adjusts automatically based on load.

Security Groups: Define security rules to control access to EC2 instances and the RDS database.

Steps
VPC Configuration:

Use CloudFormation or Terraform to define a VPC with both public and private subnets, spanning multiple AZs.

RDS Database Setup:

Deploy an RDS MySQL instance in the private subnet. Configure it for multi-AZ deployment for high availability.

EC2 Instance Setup:

Launch EC2 instances using an AMI that is pre-configured with WordPress. Place these instances in the public subnet.

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Setup:

Create an ELB to distribute incoming traffic evenly across the EC2 instances.

Auto Scaling Setup:

Configure an Auto Scaling group for the EC2 instances to scale in and out based on demand.

Security Group Configuration:

Define security groups for both the RDS instance and EC2 instances to restrict access appropriately.

DNS Configuration:

Use Route 53 to manage the domain and point it to the ELB.

SSL/TLS Setup:

Implement AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to provision a free SSL/TLS certificate and associate it with the ELB for secure connections.

Deployment with IaC
Write CloudFormation or Terraform templates to automate the creation of all the resources described above.

The templates should allow for customization and reusability for future projects
